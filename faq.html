                <q>How did you get this data?</q>
                <a>I found tons of United Kingdom 2011 Census tables, that's literally it.</a>

            <div class="question-item">
                <q>Why postcode sectors?</q>
                <a>
                    Because the UK settlement system is weird and split up their towns in like 25,000
                    ways (and also the fact that there isn't census data for a lot of big places, and also
                    also I tried to include parishes and all that but it's really hard because of the
                    fact that English people aren't creative with their names and use the same one whenever
                    they can).

            <div class="question-item">
                <q>Why did you make this?</q>
                <a>
                    I am fascinated by the United States Census Bureau's data viewer, and so I
                    decided to make my own for the United Kingdom. Read more at the
                    <a href="/about.html">About</a> section.

            <div class="question-item">
                <q>Can you provide me with some facts?</q>
                <a>Sure. The most populous postcode sector is E12 6 (25,962) and the least populous is
                    EC1V 2 (121). The largest postcode sector by area is NE48 1 (436.83 km<sup>2</sup>),
                    and the smallest postcode sector by area is M60 7 (0.0034 km<sup>2</sup>). The
                    postcode sector with the most males is E12 6 (13,906) and the one with the most
                    females is HU7 4 (12,090). The postcode sector with the most households without
                    cars is E14 9 (4,824) and the one with the least is BA1 9 (2). The most densely
                    populated postcode selector is M60 7 (137,060 km<sup>2</sup>) and the least densely
                    populated one is NE48 1 (1.749 km<sup>2</sup>)

            <div class="question-item">
                <q>Why are only England and Wales on here?</q>
                <a>Because for whatever reason, postcode selector results only apply to England and Wales. I'll make a Scotland and Northern Ireland census viewer someday.</a>

            <div class="question-item">
                <q>Why is the data from 2011 rather than 2021?</q>
                <a>Because the UK haven't released their 2021 census data yet. I'll be sure to update this site as soon as it comes out.</a>
